  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/lottie/
    - assets/svg/

  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo/Cairo-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

    - family: PlayfairDisplay
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/PlayfairDisplay/PlayfairDisplay-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/PlayfairDisplay/PlayfairDisplay-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
